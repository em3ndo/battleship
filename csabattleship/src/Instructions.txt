
The basic object of the game of Battleship is to hide your five ship fleet somewhere on your ocean and by calling out
basic coordinates, find your opponent's fleet before they find yours. There may be variations in the specific rules
depending on the version being played.

The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. The ships can be of different sizes, with the
largest being 5 squares long. A player calls out a coordinate on the grid (like "row 5, column 5"), and the java console
announces whether it is a hit or miss. The game ends when one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships. Players
must keep track of their own and their opponent's shots on a separate record grid.
