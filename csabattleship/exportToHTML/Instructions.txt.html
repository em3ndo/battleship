<span class="s0">The basic object of the game of Battleship is to hide your five ship fleet somewhere on your ocean and by calling out</span>
<span class="s0">basic coordinates, find your opponent's fleet before they find yours. There may be variations in the specific rules</span>
<span class="s0">depending on the version being played.</span>

<span class="s0">The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. The ships can be of different sizes, with the</span>
<span class="s0">largest being 5 squares long. A player calls out a coordinate on the grid (like &quot;row 5, column 5&quot;), and the java console</span>
<span class="s0">announces whether it is a hit or miss. The game ends when one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships. Players</span>
<span class="s0">must keep track of their own and their opponent's shots on a separate record grid.</span>
